- added ac_hack path (dirty hack directly in configure script with remove
  -L$(libdir) from linking parameters and this is hack because for allow
  regenerate ac files must be first rewrited ac suit :>),
- added --witout cxx bcond handling for not produce C++ bindings subpackages.
  NOTE: now ncurses builded --without cxx can produce correct result on system
  with uCibc instead glibc.
